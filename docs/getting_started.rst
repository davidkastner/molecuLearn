Getting Started
===============

*Welcome to molecuLearn!*

1 Overview
----------
The objective of molecuLearn (mL), is to facilitate the application of machine learning to extract patterns from ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations.


2 Installation
--------------
Install the package by running the follow commands inside the repository. This will perform a developmental version install. It is good practice to do this inside of a virtual environment. A yaml environmental file has been created to automate the installation of dependencies.

**Creating python environment**
All the dependencies can be loaded together using the prebuilt environment.yml or environment_dev.yml files.
We provide two YAML files. The dev version contains additional packages for code maintenance.
Compatibility is automatically tested for python versions 3.8 and higher.
If you are only going to be using the package run:

::

    bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    source activate ml


**Setup developing environment**
To begin working with molecuLearn, first clone the repo and then move into the top-level directory of the package.
The perform a developer install.
Remember to update your GitHub [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

::

    bash
    git clone git@github.com:davidkastner/molecuLearn.git
    cd molecuLearn
    python -m pip install -e .
